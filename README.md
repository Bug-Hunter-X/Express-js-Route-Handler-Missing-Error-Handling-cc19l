This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  lack of error handling for invalid input. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.  The issue is centered around parsing a user ID from the request parameters without adequate validation, resulting in potential crashes or unexpected responses if the ID isn't a valid number.
